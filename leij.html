	<h2>PUNTA ARENAS</h2>
		<p>summer daylight in punta arenas is hard and clean. what is lacked in brightness is compensated for in symmetry; the strait sings quietly, still barely audible at souvenir stands on the plaza de armas. the wind is threaded through mirrored glass, or whatever it is that stands in for the ozone layer in a place so close to passing meteors and the idle threat of a glacial speck of cancer. to climb a concrete staircase is to move both forward and backward vis a vis the promise of antarctica.</p>
		<p class="italic right-align">travel tips:<br>
			cross magellan in the rain to hide from giants when the sun sparks fires at their feet.<br>
			know that seasons are inverted in pursuit of static.<br>
			find shackleton and buy him a drink.<br>
			learn croatian.</p>
		<p>a city of grey bricks and measured breath, inhaling a memory of snow, exhaling its anticipation.</p>

	<h2>RAPTURE AND THE COCHLEA, RESPECTIVELY</h2>
		<p>i have seen lightning from an airplane and somewhere in the black sky between lima and new york &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; between miraflores and bushwick &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;between gestures toward the andes and gazes averted from the catskills the air trembled with a violence rivaled only by that of the internalization of a cloud pierced with gold and in some moments we are alive only with our eyes and our blood pressure &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and in some moments we die obsessing over love as a construct &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and in some moments our lungs are paralyzed with the understanding of sound &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and on occasion there is a sick lust for the future drowned in salt water and what is left when bourbon evaporates as skin cells race themselves into the ground</p>
		<p>but you can read on my cheekbones that i have never possessed a mountain and my body is a cluster of negative ions roaring back into the atlantic where the silver in my ears will be mined for plated necklaces and i have only ever been here breathing the hum of a ceiling fan in the seconds before sleep as gravel and spasms of hope and a spirit is far less reliable than a collection of floorboards but in moments on airplanes we are likely to believe in electricity before any faith in gravity or the limits of a pulse —</p>

	<h2>HAVANA</h2> 
		<p>i had a dream that che guevara acquired an additional dimension or two, helped himself down from the monument at revolution square, and jumped off the malecon in early spring. birds flew in reverse for at least five seconds and the party in parque g observed a hesitant moment of silence. rum in vedado ran thicker. abuela blockades sighed and handed their housekeys to children.</p>

	<h2>IF/THEN</h2>
		<p>in my dream, you said, “if i killed you,<br>
		new york would be gone before you took your last breath.”</p>

		<p>i said, “that’s the sweetest thing i’ve ever heard,” but i knew<br>
		that heartbeats are permanent the same way the rockaways are permanent, in that<br>
		they have to be swallowed by the rising oceans before anything can hope to cease.<br>
		before kingsbridge can gentrify, before anyone can agree on<br>
		where new rochelle belongs.</p>

		<p>but you, if i killed you, the chemical composition of the gowanus<br>
		would confound any unfortunate scientist. i became human on cement<br>
		stubbornly sunk into the east river<br>
		and it would melt away in an instant like impatient organic matter.</p>

		<p>if we died, new york would grow awkward wings. chaos would erupt<br>
		at every fruit stand in chinatown: the fish across the street come back to life.<br>
		we would be buried in<br>
		hoboken as cheap revenge.</p>

		<p>here, i am trying to live the way the bridge lives, in<br>
		permanence, in<br>
		steepness, in<br>
		arch, in<br>
		opposition to the wind.<br>
		but so far the sea has only just barely shaken a fist at the train.<br>
		new york will survive my demise by your hypothesis.</p>

	<h2>POETRY ABOUT A SUBJECT OF CRISIS</h2>

		<p>i don’t know how to swim.</p>

		<p class="tab-1">senses of taste lost in absolutes<br>
		clung to what we thought was algae<br>
		but now know to be cement.</p>
		
		<p>the river is beautiful from here.</p>
		
		<p>in some ways &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;it is 1994<br>
		in some ways &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;i am rain.</p>

		<p class="right-align">opacity, as someone must have said once,<br>
		is always the color of water.</p>


	<h2>POEMS IN ABEYANCE <span class="italic">(or, survey of a cryogenic chamber where things i will one day have written can hang out sans any of the health risks generally associated with inactivity or age)</span></h2>

	<p class="align-center">1.<br>
		inside a dusty book of brecht’s poetry i found a receipt from<br>
		a liquor store in tribeca<br>
	dated three summers ago, good condition</p>

	<p class="align-center">2.<br>
	when i think about you i think about death, mostly<br>
	but sometimes also professionalism</p>

	<p class="align-center">3.<br>
	to reflect on measurement as trivial not aspirational, to trace<br>
	sunlight? i would wait hours to make a phone call as such,<br>
	considering wires as they melt into satellites.<br>
	i would cut your hair. <span class="italic">i wrote this waiting for a bus on city island</span></p>

	<p class="align-center">4.<br>
	i have found the hysterical in everything</p>

	<p class="align-center">5.<br>
	when you look at the distance between mercury and neptune,<br>
	you and i are actually very close</p>

	<p class="align-center">6.<br>
	<span class="italic">a love poem to vendors of illicit southern cigarettes in new york<br>
	city; a kind chronology of my own life punctuated by the curve of<br>
	their steadily rising price point - but only the concept survives</span></p>

	<p class="align-center">7.<br>
	these women don’t like your friends<br>
	i don’t like your friends either but i bought you coffee<br>
	does that make me complicit?</p>

	<p class="align-center">8.<br>
	these years i breathe like low tide</p>

	<p class="align-center">9.<br>
	i think about the dawn in much the same way i think about<br>
	vodka in a freezer</p>

	<p class="align-center">10.<br>
	as feminized labor remains that of reproduction, it becomes<br>
	increasingly imperative that conflict be embraced as<br>
	a reproductive form. <span class="italic">i still mythologize each - fleeting -<br>
	idea of violence</span></p>

	<p class="align-center">11.<br>
	we accumulate truism without blinking.<br>
	we are all jenny holzer in minneapolis, we are all the<br>
	king james bible.</p>

	<p class="align-center">12.<br>
	-submit poetry to nowhere</p>
